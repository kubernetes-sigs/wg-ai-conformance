# wg-ai-conformance

Proposals and discussions for the [AI Conformance Working Group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-ai-conformance).

## Defining AI Conformance Requirements

Discussions for AI conformance requirements are now tracked using the
[WG AI Conformance Requirements](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/114)
GitHub Project, shifting from the original
[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXoSdh9FEs13Yde8DivCYjjXyxa7j4J8erjZPEGWuzc/edit?tab=t.0).

Each requirement is tracked as a GitHub issue with the following workflow:
- **Todo**: Requirements currently under discussion.
- **In Progress**: Requirements that have been accepted by the working group.
- **Done**: Requirements that have been added to the [cncf/ai-conformance](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance) repository.

To participate, please comment on the relevant GitHub issues.
Unresolved items will be discussed during the
[recurring WG meeting](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-ai-conformance#meetings).

## Designing AI Conformance Tests

Discussions for how we design AI conformance tests are tracked using the
[WG AI Conformance Tests Design](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/118)
GitHub Project.

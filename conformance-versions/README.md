# Conformance Versions

Kubernetes AI Conformance follows Kubernetes Releases. Therefore the corresponding Version is always towards the Kubernetes Version e.g `KubernetesAIConformance-1.33.yaml` corrolates to `Kubernetes v1.33`

In this folder are the Conformance requirements for each Kubernetes Version supported by the Kubernetes AI Conformance Programm. 

The files in this Folder are the final Version and will be transfered to the [cncf/ai-conformance](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance) repository.
